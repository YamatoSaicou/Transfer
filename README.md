# Transfer
This is a program which can transfer the easy png file to "Character composed of patterns". It is based on python 3.6.3 and use package "Image" to deal with the image. Also, it use "argparse" to support more command line command.
## About the command
1. There are two types of python file. For the Transfer.py, the command is "python Transfer.py filename -o outputfilename". The -o outputfilename is optinal.
2. For the Transfer-2.py,  the command is "python Transfer-2.py filename -o outputfilename -width -height". The -o, outputfilename, -width ,-height is optinal.
3. The output.txt and the output2.txt are the example of wm.png.
## Some ideas about the program
This time I learn some interesting things from the program, especially "argparse". This is my first time to use it. And it's the first time I learn to deal with the recommended command-line parsing.
